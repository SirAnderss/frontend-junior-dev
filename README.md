```

If you're a recruiter you're welcome to fork this repository and use it in your recruitment process.

In case you're a developer, use it as a homework to practice or learn how to build a UI with TailwindCSS and consuming a Rest API.

## Rules ☝

1. **Not fork!** Clone this repository.
2. **Use this template**. We don't want to evaluate how do you configure compilers or environment.
3. You have **5 days** to send this test. 

## Tasks 👩‍💻👨‍💻

The milestone is seen how you're programming a UI built with `TailwindCSS` + `Vue 2.X` + `Rest API`.


1. Open the [UI Design on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/950862986864665765) also is in the `/assets` folder.
2. Programing the UI as the most similar possible as you can.
3. Render a Pie chart with the data that returns the API in the endpoint `/api/reports`. The chart library you can choose freely, but consider that the future charts will be simple not too complex.
4. Render a table with the users data that returns the API in the endpoint `/api/users`. Take as a guide the UI design.
5. Create a dropdown menu in the top right corner, bottom of profile photo. The profile photo can get [from here](https://generated.photos/faces).
6. Ensure that all works, we don't fix the code of all applicants 😫.
7. Upload to your favorite code version platform like Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket **as public repository**. Please not set as private! 
8. Send the repository link to the same channel you receive the instructions.
9. Seat, relax and wait to result, success!

## Considerations

The mock API was created with [Miragejs](https://miragejs.com/) and [Fakerjs](https://github.com/Marak/Faker.js#readme). All data will be random, so we hope not see any type of static text in the chart and table, except for columns names and titles.

The Tailwind version is `2.0.3`, so read the [latest documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This project use eslint with `vue recommended` and `eslint default` rules. You can check [vue recommended rules here](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/) and [eslint default rules here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

**Suggestion: Focus on the tasks firstly, then in the details.**
